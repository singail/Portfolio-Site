# Portfolio Site Project

## About the project

This project is a part of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program of Udacity. As a student I had to build a responsive web developer portfolio site from scratch. My goal was to make a fully responsive site that presents my projects that I did during the course. I also added a link to projects that I did outside of the course program. 

## How to run the page
